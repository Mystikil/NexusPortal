# Living World Protocol

The Living World Protocol keeps the realm of Nexus One evolving in real time. Weather, factions, commerce, and creatures respond to each victory or defeat, ensuring that the world never feels static.

## Seasonal Cadence
- **Cycle Length:** 21 real-world days.
- **Phase Order:** Dawnrise &rarr; Zenith &rarr; Duskwane.
- **Rotation Rules:** Server maintenance on Mondays pushes the cycle forward if the current phase is over 48 hours old.
- **Seasonal Overrides:** World votes or major boss kills can advance the cycle instantly.

### Seasonal Effects
| Phase | World Effect | City Impact | Wilderness Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dawnrise | Enhanced crafting yields | Markets stock rare reagents | Flora blooms and foraging nodes respawn twice as fast |
| Zenith | PvE faction contracts award +15% gold | Town guards patrol more frequently, reducing crime penalties | Monster density increases near shard rifts |
| Duskwane | Shadow events open every four hours | Night-only merchants appear | Undead and spectral foes replace standard spawns |

## Dynamic Faction Web
- **Three Factions:** Aetherwatch, Crimson Choir, Verdant Veil.
- **Alignment Drift:** Completing contracts or slaying lieutenants pushes the balance of power by 1&ndash;3 points.
- **Dominance Thresholds:** At 40 points a faction claims the current province, unlocking themed public quests.
- **Fail States:** Ignoring a faction for three days triggers a counter-offensive that can flip held territory.

### Faction Benefits
- **Aetherwatch:** Reduced fast-travel costs and a 5% spell critical bonus in controlled zones.
- **Crimson Choir:** Weapon imbues last 20% longer and bounty boards spawn elite hunts.
- **Verdant Veil:** Mount stamina drain halved and all gathering yields +1 bonus resource.

## Environmental Storylines
- **Anchor Sites:** Twelve world anchor sites rotate featured story arcs each cycle.
- **Instanced Memories:** Completing a storyline grants a replayable memory shard with unique cosmetics.
- **Cascading Outcomes:** Success or failure at an anchor site modifies weather patterns and NPC dialogue across the realm for the next phase.

## Settlement Vitality
- **Wellbeing Score:** Each settlement tracks supply, morale, defense, and arcane shielding (0&ndash;100 scale).
- **Input Sources:** Player deliveries, faction control, and event completions.
- **Consequences:**
  - 80+ unlocks festival vendors and bonus XP buffs.
  - 50&ndash;79 keeps standard services online.
  - 20&ndash;49 forces curfews: banks close at dusk and taxes rise 5%.
  - &lt;20 triggers evacuation quests, shutting down amenities until resolved.

## Living Bestiary
- **Adaptive Spawns:** Each biome tracks population pressure. Overhunting pushes apex beasts into nearby regions.
- **Convergence Events:** When two apex beasts overlap, a world boss emerges with rotating mechanics.
- **Conservation Tasks:** Weekly research contracts restore balance and grant eco-ally titles.

## Player Influence Checklist
1. Track the current phase via the in-game atlas or `/living-world` portal page.
2. Rally your guild to support a settlement before its wellbeing falls below 40.
3. Complete faction contracts daily to lock in bonuses before Duskwane destabilizes control.
4. Scan anchor site schedules every Sunday to prepare for cascading storylines.
5. Bring conservation lures when overfarming a biome to avoid convergence disasters.

## Rewards & Progression

- **Cycle Vault:** Weekly caches aligned to the dominant faction, containing gear upgrades and crafting catalysts.
- **Legacy Echoes:** Long-term achievements that track how many cycles you defended, restored, or conquered provinces.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**A:** No. Control is capped per guild by province; cooperation across factions is required to maintain bonuses.

**Q:** _What happens if all settlements collapse?_  
**A:** Emergency refugees spawn in the capital, unlocking a realm-wide rally event. Completing it restores every settlement to 35 wellbeing.

**Q:** _How do I know when convergence events are active?_  
**A:** Check the skybox for aurora fractures or open the `/events` tracker. The portal page also lists active convergence timers.

**Q:** _Does the Living World impact PvP?_  
**A:** Seasonal phases grant small stat shifts (+2% damage during Zenith, +5% lifesteal during Duskwane nights) but PvP brackets remain skill-based.
